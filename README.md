## Kinedu-Frontend-Test
Frontend Engineer Project for applying to Kinedu's Software Engineering team.

This App was a test for entry to the Software Engineering team at Kinedu's.

# What it does:
It has a very simple Backend that makes the consults to the Kinedu's API and gets the info needed.
The info consist of two sections of Skills, and a couple of Milestones of each skill section.
So the Frontend shows a Title and a Description for each Skill, and each milestone they had.
At each Milestone, the user can mark as Completed or Uncompleted.
When it finishes, the user confirms the finished and sends an object with each ID of the Milestone and the status of that Milestone to the Backend.

# To try out:
Clone the repository on your local file system.
Open the folder with any code editor (Like Visual Studio Code).
In the terminal, go can follow these steps:
1) cd .\api\
2) npm install
3) npm start
*Open a new terminal WITHOUT closing the current terminal*
4) cd .\client\
5) npm install
6) npm start
*When is ready, it should open your navigator and see the web page*

# Hope you like it!
